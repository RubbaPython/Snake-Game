## Introduction
A simple and well-known Snake game made in **Python**.

The goal with this application/game was to understand how to create your own **Classes** in **Python**, how to implement them to make a reusable and clean code structure.

GUI was not created from scratch, but instead I used **Python Turtle** library to do so.

The game also keeps track of your highest score, by putting it into a separate .txt file.

## Technologies

+ Python **3.x**

+ **Python Turtle**
 
## Setup

1. Download the game locally 

2. Start the ```main.py``` from terminal or open the full **project folder** in any IDE and launch the main.py file

### Controls

+ **Move Left** - Arrow key left
+ **Move Right** - Arrow key right

## Status

The game is finished, but as bugs can occur here and there, I may come back to it to update and patch up.
